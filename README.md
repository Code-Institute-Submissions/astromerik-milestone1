The main purpose of this website is threefolded. Firstly, since the webpage is a portfolio/resume page I wanted it to reflect my personality and my idea of good UX. In other words, a web page that I would like to spend some time on. 
It should be easy for me to handle contact information from users who want to come in contact with me. 
Secondly, the web page is mainly aimed towards recruiters and potential emplyers, thus, the web site must be intuitive and easy to navigate on. It should provide all the neccesary information to understand what I can accomplish and how I am as a developer. 
Lastly, This wep page is supposed to develop along with me. This means that it will be written in clean code, available for additional languages to be inserted (for example JavaScript). This also means that the content on the page prefferably will be scaled downed to provide a clean look and also be more easely managed in future development/changes.
