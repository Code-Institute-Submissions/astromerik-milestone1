The main purpose of this website is threefolded. Firstly, since the webpage is a portfolio/resume page I wanted it to reflect my personality and my idea of good UX. In other words, a website that I would like to spend some time on. 
It should be easy for me to handle contact information from users who want to come in contact with me. 
Secondly, the website is mainly aimed towards recruiters and potential emplyers, thus, the web site must be intuitive and easy to navigate on. It should provide all the neccesary information to understand what I can accomplish and how I am as a developer. 
Lastly, This wep page is supposed to develop along with me. This means that it will be written in clean code, available for additional languages to be inserted (for example JavaScript). This also means that the content on the page prefferably will be scaled downed to provide a clean look and also be more easely managed in future development/changes.

## Features

The page features a navigation bar on the top and a footer on the bottom which both are fixed. 
The naviation bar contains a logotype on the top ledt which is clickable and takes you to the top section of the page (the home page).
It also contains all the different sections on the website (home, about, skills, projects, contact), which takes the user down to the specific section when clicked.
When the screen size is below 768 pixels, the navbar collapses and only showing the logotype and a hamburger button. When the hamburger button is clicked, the diferent sections colapses in a list (which is of course clickable).

The footer is kept as clean as possible and only consists of social media links which will take the user to my social media pages (Twitter, LinkedIn, Github and Slack). 
However, the Slack-logo takes the user to Slacks main page since one need to link the workspace and this is not suitable at the moment. 

#### Home

The home page is the most simpel page on the website. It contains a welcome message, a profile picture and a short scentence of how this website was built (including the icons for each language/library).
The home page is responsive even thoug the profile picture is set to a fixed size.
